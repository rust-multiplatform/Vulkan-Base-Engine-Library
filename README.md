# Rust Multi-Platform: Base Engine Library

> THIS IS A LIBRARY.

This project is supported by **all** Rust platforms and is to be used by other projects of the Rust Multi-Platform and may or may not be useless outside the project scope.

## Licenses

This project is dual licensed in Rust's fashion:

- [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)
- [Apache License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html)

For your own project you can chose whichever fits you better.
For templates/examples we recommend to also dual-licensing.

## Targets & Architectures

This project is aiming to work across all platforms **and targets**.
All **Tier 1** targets are tested in CI's of this repository.
Additionally, _some_ **Tier 2** targets are tested.

However, this should work on all targets. If you find an issue please report it.

## Building

This is a simple Rust and Cargo project.  
Simply use the build-in commands:

For debug builds:  

```shell
cargo build
```

For release builds:  

```shell
cargo build --release
```

## Continuous Integration

This project utilizes the GitHub Actions CI (= Continuous Integration) to showcase how to build for all platforms.
For most platforms we just need a runner on the target platform (Windows, Linux or macOS) and install Rust.
This can be simply done by following [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) (check the [other install options](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html) for automatically installing inside an CI).
Something like:

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain stable --profile full -y
```

should work for most platforms.

Note that we _may_ need more tools installed depending on the CI provider and platform.
Check the host <-> target matrix at [Building & Running](#Building-&-Running)

Additionally, often we have to `source` the profile changes. Something like:

```shell
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Additionally we have templates for other CI platforms.
Please note that some platforms are just a basic example on how to build part of this project, e.g. building only the `platform_linux` package.
This is done to save on build costs/minutes.

> Please note, that if just one CI platform is failing, it is most likely linked to a plan or build credit issue on said platform.
> GitHub Actions is **NOT** limited for open source repositories.
> If GitHub Actions succeed, all other CI platforms _should_ succeed as well.

### CI Platform: GitHub Actions

[![Base Engine Library](https://github.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Engine-Library/actions/workflows/library.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Engine-Library/actions/workflows/library.yml)

### CI Platform: Azure DevOps

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Rust-Multiplatform/Base%20Project%20Template/_apis/build/status/Base%20Project%20Template?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/Rust-Multiplatform/Base%20Project%20Template/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=main)

Azure DevOps is an amazing platform which includes not only CI/CDs (pipelines), but you can host your Git repository there too, do planning, and much more.
The Azure Pipelines are surprisingly extensive and feature rich, next to GitHub definitely a good choice!

We also do build for all platforms, however please note that you either have to pay for a subscription (might be included with an Visual Studio/MSDN subscription!) or, if applicable, apply for a shared pipeline runner.
This is possible for not only public, but also private projects.
In fact I do have private projects on there.

### CI Platform: CircleCI

On CircleCI we also support each package, but we only have one badge for the whole pipeline.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/tree/main)

> Note that a failure here can also mean we run out of credits. Happens too often unfortunately!

### CI Platform: Travis

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template)

On Travis we only build for Windows, macOS and Linux.
Android and iOS _would_ be possible, however it requires a lot more work.
The Android SDK and iOS SDK must be installed, xcode tool, cross compilers, etc.

Additionally, we want to save on build credits here.

> Note a failure or unknown status may be linked to used up credits and/or plan.

### CI Platform: GitLab CI

To use GitLab CI we mirror our repository from GitHub to GitLab.

Currently, we are only building `platform_linux`. Other platforms should be possible.

### CI Platform: BitBucket Pipeline

Unfortunately, BitBucket Pipelines don't have status badges.

The pipelines are available at: [BitBucket Mirror](https://bitbucket.org/rust-multiplatform/base-project-template/)

### CI Platform: TeamCity

| Pipeline | Status Badge                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build    | ![TeamCity build status](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/builds/buildType:id:OpenSourceProjects_RustMultiplatform_BaseProjectTemplate_Build/statusIcon.svg) |
| Test     | ![TeamCity test status](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/builds/buildType:id:OpenSourceProjects_RustMultiplatform_BaseProjectTemplate_Test/statusIcon.svg)   |

To use [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) you either have to host your own Server, subscribe for a hosted (TeamCity Cloud) server or apply for your [OSS project being added for free](https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2016/10/hosted-teamcity-for-open-source-a-new-home/).

Unfortunately, TeamCity depends highly on hosted Agents and for OSS only Linux (ubuntu) is available.
Our pipeline only builds the `platform_linux` package (and internally `shared`).
Building other platforms is possible (Windows: Cross-Compilation with MinGW, WebAssembly & Android: "Natively" supported), but requires a more complicated setup.

Furthermore, the platforms macOS and iOS can't be build without having your own Agent running on a Mac.
There is the [Docker-OSX](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX) project which makes it possible to run macOS under Docker. Hard to setup and requires a lot of resources for "just building" an app.

Windows builds would also be much easier if we'd have an agent for it.

### CI Platform: AppVeyor

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/nsffumoc868yqsrj/branch/main?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Sakul6499/base-project-template/branch/main)

Simple pipeline to showcase the usage of Rust on AppVeyor.  
Linux only currently, but [Windows](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/windows-images-software/) and [macOS](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/macos-images-software/) are possible.

### CI Platform: Jenkins

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.sakul-flee.de/buildStatus/icon?job=github_rust_multiplatform%2FBase-Project-Template%2Fmain)](https://jenkins.sakul-flee.de/job/github_rust_multiplatform/job/Base-Project-Template/job/main/)

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is another multi-purpose self-hosted CI platform.

The configuration file can be found under `.jenkins/Jenkinsfile` and includes both: A Docker build version using the official [Rust Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) and a native installation (local Agent with [Rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) installed).  
**You won't need both**, exclude whatever configuration you won't need.

## Coverage

A combination of [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) and [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) is used to provide code-to-test coverage.  
**Please note that it is impossible to reach 100% coverage on some platforms as e.g. bindgen-code (i.e. dynamically generated code / macros) is NOT covered by `grcov` and certain platform specific tools (like `cargo-apk`) generate additional code that also is NOT included in the coverage.**

Test-to-Code coverage status: [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=XpGvuQVirP)](https://codecov.io/gh/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template)

Below are several charts showing/highlighting the distribution of **all platforms**.
