| [platform/android/](platform/android/)         | Contains the Android platform project and instructions on how to build this project for Android and run it.                         |
| [platform/ios/](platform/ios/)                 | Contains the iOS platform project and instructions on how to build this project for iOS and run it.                                 |
| [platform/linux/](platform/linux/)             | Contains the Linux platform project and instructions on how to build this project for Linux and run it.                             |
| [platform/macos/](platform/macos/)             | Contains the macOS platform project and instructions on how to build this project for macOS and run it.                             |
| [platform/windows/](platform/windows/)         | Contains the Windows platform project and instructions on how to build this project for Windows and run it.                         |

To break this down:
The [shared/](shared/) folder contains our **cross/multi-platform code**.
99.9% of what we do in this project will happen there.

Each of the projects inside [platform/](platform/) are representing a **platform specific project**.
In most cases, like for Windows, Linux and macOS, there is nothing else to do but call our shared code and compile a **binary**.
However, on certain platforms, like Android and iOS, we have to use some special commands and tools to get an e.g. .APK (Android) or .APP (iOS) file.
Furthermore, on those systems resources/assets may need to be specially loaded and their `Cargo.toml` will be much more extensive.
Simply said: For those special platforms we will use some cargo extensions which will automatically generate a native project in the background. Values from `Cargo.toml` will be used to generate those.

**Please check the `README.md` inside each platform to see how each platform is build, run and what you will need to do so.**

## Targets & Architectures

This project is aiming to work across all platforms **and targets**.
All **Tier 1** targets are tested in CI's of this repository.
Additionally, _some_ **Tier 2** targets are tested.

However, this should work on all targets. If you find an issue please report it.

[Rust's Tier Policies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html)
[Rust's Platform Support & Targets](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html)

## Building

This is a simple Rust and Cargo project.  
Simply use the build-in commands:

For debug builds:  

```shell
cargo build
```

For release builds:  

```shell
cargo build --release
```

## Continuous Integration

<<<<<<< .merge_file_Njs5g2
[![Multiplatform Build](https://github.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/actions/workflows/multiplatform-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/actions/workflows/multiplatform-build.yml)

This project utilizes the GitHub Actions CI (= Continuous Integration) to showcase how to build for all platforms.
For most platforms we just need a runner on the target platform (Windows, Linux or macOS) and install Rust.
This can be simply done by following [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) (check the [other install options](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html) for automatically installing inside an CI).
Something like:

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain stable --profile full -y
```

should work for most platforms.

Note that we _may_ need more tools installed depending on the CI provider and platform.
Check the host <-> target matrix at [Building & Running](#Building-&-Running)

Additionally, often we have to `source` the profile changes. Something like:

```shell
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Furthermore, we have templates for many other CI platforms if you prefer those:
