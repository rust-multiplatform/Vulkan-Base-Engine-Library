# Rust Multi-Platform: Base Engine Library

> THIS IS A LIBRARY.

This project is supported by **all** Rust platforms and is to be used by other projects of the Rust Multi-Platform and may or may not be useless outside the project scope.

## Licenses

This project is dual licensed in Rust's fashion:

- [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)
- [Apache License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html)

For your own project you can chose whichever fits you better.
For templates/examples we recommend to also dual-licensing.

## Targets & Architectures

This project is aiming to work across all platforms **and targets**.
All **Tier 1** targets are tested in CI's of this repository.
Additionally, _some_ **Tier 2** targets are tested.

However, this should work on all targets. If you find an issue please report it.

## Coverage

A combination of [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) and [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) is used to provide code-to-test coverage.  
**Please note that it is impossible to reach 100% coverage on some platforms as e.g. bindgen-code (i.e. dynamically generated code / macros) is NOT covered by `grcov` and certain platform specific tools (like `cargo-apk`) generate additional code that also is NOT included in the coverage.**
