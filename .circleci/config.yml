# To save on build minutes and to reduce complexity 
# we are **only** building for the current host architecture for Windows, Linux and macOS.
# Android and iOS are exceptions here.
#
# We could of course add all of our target architectures
# by simply adding the `--target <rust target>` to the build commands.
# Alternatively, use a build matrix like we did with GitHub.
